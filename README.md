## React Instagram Clone

A frontend clone of Instagram built using React JS.

#### Live Demo: https://react-instagram-clone-bb315.web.app/

Key Points:

- The application supports **CRUD**(Create/Read/Update/Delete) operations for _Instagram's Post_ like functionality. Users can upload/Edit/Delete images as post using the application after they are signed in.

- Implemented Follow/Unfollow functionality among Users.

- Implemented an _Instagram news feed_ like feature allowing users to view posts made by other users.

- Implemented Like/Un-Like and comment functionality allowing users to like/un-like and comment on posts.

- The application requires users to sign in(or sign up) to view/upload images/posts.

- Used [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) & [React-Redux](https://react-redux.js.org/) for global state management. Integrated with [Redux-Thunk](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-thunk) for creating **asynchronous** action creators that handle data fetching/uploading.

- Used [React-Router-Dom](https://reactrouter.com/web/guides/philosophy) for navigating between pages.

- Used [firebase's](https://firebase.google.com/) cloud Firestore for database and Firebase Authentication for Sign In/Sign Out functionality.
